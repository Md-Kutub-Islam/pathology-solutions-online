# Pathology Solution Online+

Overview

Pathology Solution Online+ is a web application designed to streamline the process of booking pathology tests. Users can create an account, browse available labs, book a test, and complete payments online with ease. The platform offers multiple pathology labs to choose from, allowing users to select the best option for their needs. The application also provides a seamless experience with pages for user registration, login, profile management, and more.

Built using the MERN stack, Pathology Solution Online leverages React.js, Redux Toolkit, and TailwindCSS on the frontend, with a backend powered by Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Razorpay is integrated as the payment gateway, and JWT authentication with email verification ensures secure user accounts. Additionally, Cloudinary is used for image storage, allowing for efficient handling of user-uploaded images.
